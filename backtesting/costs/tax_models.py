"""
Tax Impact Models

Implements tax impact models for backtesting:
- Short-term vs long-term capital gains
- Wash sale rules
- First-in-first-out (FIFO) vs specific identification
- Mark-to-market election (Section 475)
- Tax loss harvesting opportunities

Tax considerations can significantly impact after-tax returns.
Proper tax modeling is essential for realistic backtesting,
especially for taxable accounts.

Note: This models US tax law. Consult tax professionals for
specific situations. Tax laws change frequently.
